            updates or upgrades to the software and any related documentation)
            that we make available to you from time to time for your use in
            connection with Wild Movie Services (“Wild Movie Software”).
          </Para>
          <Para>
            If we provide specific Terms for the Wild Movie Software and there
            is a conflict between the specific Terms for the Wild Movie Software
            and these Conditions of Use, the specific Terms for the Wild Movie
            Software will govern. Applicable Law By using any Wild Movie
            Service, you agree that the laws of the state of Washington, without
            regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these
            Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise
            between you and Wild Movie. Disputes Any dispute or claim relating
            in any way to your use of any Wild Movie Service, or any products or
            services sold or distributed by Wild Movie or through the Wild Movie
            Services will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in
            court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if
            your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal
            arbitration law apply to this agreement. a. There is no judge or
            jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is
            limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the
            same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and
            declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms
            of these Conditions of Use as a court would. b. To begin an
            arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting
            arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent
            Corporation Service Company, 300 Deschutes Way SW, Suite 304,
            Tumwater, WA 98051. The arbitration will be conducted by the
            American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including
            the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.
            The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling
            1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator
            fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules.
          </Para>
          <Para>
            We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000
            unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise,
            Wild Movie will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration
            unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may
            choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on
            written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at
            another mutually agreed location. c. You and Wild Movie each agree
            that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an
            individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative
            action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in
            arbitration you and Wild Movie each waive any right to a jury trial.
            You and Wild Movie also both agree that you or we may bring suit in
            court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual
            property rights. Site Policies, Modification, and Severability
            Please review our other policies. These policies also govern your
            use of Wild Movie Services. We reserve the right to make changes to
            our site, policies, and these our site, policies, Terms, and these
            Conditions of Use at any time. If any of these conditions shall be
            deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that
            condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the
            validity and enforceability of any remaining condition. Our Address

            offer automatic or manual updates at any time and without notice to
            you. Export Regulations; Government End Users. You must comply with
            all export and re-export restrictions and regulations of the
            Department of Commerce and other United States agencies and
            authorities that may apply to the Wild Movie Software. If you are a

            to you as a Commercial Item as that term is defined in the U.S. Code

            important part of our business, and we are not in the business of
            selling our users personal information to others. We share user
            information with our parent corporation (Amazon.com, Inc.), the
            subsidiaries it controls that follow practices at least as
            protective as those described in this Privacy Notice, and as
            described below. Transactions involving Third Parties: We make
            available to you services provided by third parties. For example,
            you can purchase movie tickets from third parties through Showtimes
            and Tickets. You can tell when a third party is involved in your
            transactions, and we share users personal information related to
            those transactions with that third party. Third-Party Service
            Providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform
            functions on our behalf.

            our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In
            such transactions, user information generally is one of the
            transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made
            in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the user
            consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Wild
            Movie.com, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired,
            user information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
            Protection of Wild Movie and Others: We release account and other

            For more information about third-party advertising at Wild Movie,
            including interest-based ads, please read the Amazon Interest-Based
            Ads policy. To adjust your advertising preferences, please go to the

            or third-party websites. Use of Third-Party Advertising Services: We
            provide ad companies with information that allows them to serve you
            with more useful and relevant Wild Movie ads and to measure their
            effectiveness. We never share your name or other information that
            directly identifies you when we do this.
          </Para>
          <Para>
            Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie or other
            device identifier. For example, if you have already downloaded one
            of our apps, we will share your advertising identifier and data
            about that event so that you will not be served an ad to download
            the app again. Some ad companies also use this information to serve
            you relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about
            how to opt-out of interest-based advertising by going to the Amazon
            Advertising Preferences page. How Secure Is Information About Me? We
            design our systems with your security and privacy in mind. We work
            to protect the security of your personal information during
            transmission by using encryption protocols and software. We maintain
            physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with
            collection, storage, and disclosure of personal customer

            request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to
            you. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access
            to your password and to your computers, devices, and applications.

            prevent your browser or device from accepting new cookies or other
            identifiers, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a
            new cookie, or how to block cookies altogether. Because cookies

            how to change your device permissions on devices manufactured by
            third parties, we recommend you contact your mobile service carrier
